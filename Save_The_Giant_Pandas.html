	<p><b><h3>Habitat Destruction and Loss</h3></b></p>
 One the main reasons that panda populations has declined is habitat destruction. As the human population in China continues to grow, pandas' habitat gets taken over by development, pushing them into smaller and less livable areas. Habitat destruction also leads to food shortages.Therefore, less food means that a lot of pandas don't get a meal.This cuases them to starve.Think about it, the are only about 2060 pandas living in the wild, they are very vulnerable of extinction.People are predicting that if we don't do anything pandas will be extict by 2020, only 3 years away!

 <b><h4>Why we should save the giant pandas</h4></b>
 <p>The bamboo a panda eats or the bamboo forests are helpful. The nutrients in the bamboo can help create biofuel. This biofuel can be helpful to our enviornment.It's like a veggie bus(a bus that runs on only veggie oil or veggie scraps). This is very helpful and we can't let deforestation happen.</p>
